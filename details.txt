Paragraph on coding it

I initially estimated four (4) hours to complete this project assignment.  It
took me three (3) hours total.  I think I estimated four (4) hours for manually
working on the gui elements and manually working on the validation logic.  I
normally generate this type of screen from an database table which would take less
than two (2) hours.
